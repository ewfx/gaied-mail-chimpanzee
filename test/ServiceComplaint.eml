Subject: Complaint Regarding Service - Loan Account 3746501928
Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:15:00 +0530

Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received on March 20, 2025, when I called regarding my loan account 3746501928. The representative I spoke with, who I believe was named John, was unhelpful and did not address my concerns about a recent fee of $35.00.

I would appreciate it if you would investigate this matter and take appropriate action to resolve it.

Sincerely,
Isabella Wright
