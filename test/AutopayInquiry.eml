Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am interested in setting up automatic payments for my loan account 3456789012. Could you please provide information on how to enroll in autopay, including any required forms or steps? I would like the payment to be debited from my checking account ending in XXXX-5678 on the 20th of each month.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Sophia Davis
