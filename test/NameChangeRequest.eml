Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am requesting a name change on my loan account 7890123456. My previous name was Ava Rodriguez, and my new legal name is Ava Martin. I have attached a copy of my marriage certificate as supporting documentation.

Please advise on any further steps required to process this request.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Ava Martin
