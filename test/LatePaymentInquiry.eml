Subject: Inquiry Regarding Late Payment - Loan Account 9876543210
Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:15:00 +0530

Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to inquire about a recent late payment on my loan account 9876543210. I believe the payment due on March 15, 2025, may have been processed late due to a temporary issue with my bank account.

Could you please provide information on any late fees incurred and the current status of my account?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
Alice Smith
