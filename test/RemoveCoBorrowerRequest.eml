Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to request information on the process of removing my ex-spouse as a co-borrower from loan account 2830194675, as per our divorce decree. I have attached a copy of the relevant section of the decree.

Please advise on the steps required.

Sincerely,
Olivia Wilson
