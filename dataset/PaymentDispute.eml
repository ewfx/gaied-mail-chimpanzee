Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to dispute a payment made on March 10, 2025, for loan account 0123456789. The amount debited was $550.00, but I believe my scheduled payment should have been $525.00.

Please investigate this matter and provide information on how to resolve this dispute. I have attached a copy of my account statement from last month as supporting documentation.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Eva Garcia
