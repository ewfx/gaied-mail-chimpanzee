Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I would like to request a copy of my original loan agreement for loan account 0987654321, which I took out on January 15, 2023.

Please advise if there are any fees associated with this request or if I can access this document online.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Daniel Allen
