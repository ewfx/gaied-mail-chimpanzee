Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to request a copy of my Tax Form 1098 (Mortgage Interest Statement) for the tax year 2024 for loan account 9012345678.

Please let me know if this has been mailed out already or if I can access it online. If not, could you please send a copy to my current address on file?

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Chloe Hall
