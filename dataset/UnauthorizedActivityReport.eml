Date: Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:15:00 +0530

Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to report unauthorized activity on my loan account 8374650192. On March 21, 2025, I noticed a withdrawal of $200.00 that I did not authorize.

Please investigate this matter immediately and advise on the necessary steps to secure my account and resolve this issue. I have attached a screenshot of my recent account activity showing the unauthorized transaction.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Ethan Cole
