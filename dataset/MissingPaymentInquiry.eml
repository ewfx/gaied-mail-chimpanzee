Dear Wells Fargo Consumer Lending Servicing Team,

I am writing to inquire about a payment I made on February 28, 2025, for loan account 8293047561. The amount was $475.00, but it is not showing in my online account history. Could you please investigate this?

I have attached a copy of my bank statement as proof of payment.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Mia Adams
